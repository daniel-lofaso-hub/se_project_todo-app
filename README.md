# Simple Todo App

This is a very simple to-do app.

## Functionality

With the app, you can add/remove to-do items to a list with an optional due date, and check or uncheck each item.

## Technology

In this project, I refactored the JavaScript in OOP, structuring the file directory using modules.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on GitHub Pages:
